PrExploit is an open-source implementation for the exploit prediction focused on transparency.
Transparency is the primary issue of the exploit prediction systems because a bunch of services provides black-box systems. To spread the great idea, exploit prediction for better vulnerability handling, the goal of this project offers fully transparent implementation includes data, training methods, and explanations of prediction results.

Exploit prediction is a task to prioritize vulnerabilities and many researchers propose various methods since 2010. You can see the details about this task at the [FIRST SIG](https://www.first.org/epss/model).

PrExploit provides the following functions.

- Data collector for vulnerability and exploitation
- Model trainer for exploit prediction
- Data feed contains probabilities of exploitation and explanations
